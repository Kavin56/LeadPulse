# Assignment

HSR Motors is a car dealership which advertises their business on multiple platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc and also receives leads from their Website and other offline events and activities. Their primary goal is to get leads from people who are interested in buying a car. 

To manage the leads that they receive, they are currently using a spreadsheet software where they manually track the status of the leads (New, Contacted, Not interested, etc.). However, the spreadsheet software does not help their team to collaborate in real-time.

Their lead management team typically consists of these types of users:

1. Sales Team
   1. Goal: To reach out to the leads on phone and understand the customer's needs. They must then qualify the lead and mark the customer status appropriately.
2. Business Manager
   1. Goal: Be able to get a quick-view dashboard to understand and analyze the leads data received.

Design a web application for desktop screens that will be a one-stop solution for the team at HSR Motors. You must design at least 2 screens:

1. Screen 1 - Lead Listing
2. Screen 2 - Lead Details
3. Screen 3 - Lead Management
4. Screen 4 - Dashboard
